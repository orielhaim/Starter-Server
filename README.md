## 🎯 About This Project

Welcome to **Starter Server** - my carefully crafted, production-ready server template that I'm sharing with the developer community! This isn't just another boilerplate; it's a battle-tested, enterprise-grade foundation that incorporates years of best practices, security hardening, and real-world experience.

Whether you're building your next startup, enterprise application, or learning advanced Node.js patterns, this template provides everything you need to get started with confidence.

> **💡 Why I Built This:** After building numerous production applications, I found myself repeatedly implementing the same security measures, authentication patterns, and monitoring systems. This template consolidates all those learnings into a single, reusable foundation that you can trust with your most critical applications.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**
- **JWT-based authentication** with refresh token rotation
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** with TOTP and backup codes
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with granular permissions
- **Session management** with device tracking and remote revocation
- **Secure password hashing** using bcrypt with configurable rounds

### 🛡️ **Enterprise Security**
- **Multi-layer rate limiting** with progressive delays
- **CSRF protection** with double-submit cookie pattern
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** with nonce-based script execution
- **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)** protection
- **Comprehensive input validation** using express-validator
- **Bot detection** and automated threat mitigation

### 📊 **Monitoring & Logging**
- **Structured logging** with Winston and daily rotation
- **Request/response monitoring** with performance metrics
- **Security event tracking** with detailed audit trails
- **Health check endpoints** for load balancer integration
- **Graceful shutdown** handling with cleanup procedures

### 🚀 **Performance & Reliability**
- **Response compression** with security considerations
- **Static file serving** with proper caching headers
- **Database connection pooling** with Better SQLite3
- **Memory usage monitoring** and leak detection
- **Process management** with proper signal handling

### 🔧 **Developer Experience**
- **Environment-based configuration** with dotenv
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging
- **Request ID tracking** for distributed tracing
- **Development-friendly debugging** with detailed error messages
- **Modular architecture** for easy extension and maintenance
